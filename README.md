# Streamish

This is a project from NSS where I was tasked with making an API using ASP.NET Core Web API.
The API is used in a react front-end environment.

# Firebase Authentication

We added firebase authentication to our API and front-end, so to run it locally you must setup a firebase project.
This is not intended to be ran locally anyways, so I just put placeholders where all sensitive data was.
